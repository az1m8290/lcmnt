# lcmnt
### For the Complex Mersenne Number Transform, see https://github.com/robince/cmnt

The lcmnt binary should run from any Linux or Linux-like terminal. It either writes the comment for a specified file to the data file 
(by default cmntdata/data.txt, can be changed in the source), or reads the comment from the data file and prints it. There are also some 
miscellaneous launch parameters.

## COMPILATION 
Use the included Makefile, or compile by hand. This was only tested with g++.

## USAGE
Run `lcmnt` for a basic manual, or look at the source code to see what five entire minutes were spent on.

## BUGS
Overkill paragraph for a repository with no views.
