# lcmnt
### For the Complex Mersenne Number Transform, see https://github.com/robince/cmnt

The lcmnt binary should run from any Linux or Linux-like terminal. It either writes the comment for a specified file to the data file 
(by default cmntdata/data.txt, can be changed in the source), or reads the comment from the data file and prints it. There are also some 
miscellaneous launch parameters, but they aren't integral or even useful.

## COMPILATION 
Use the included (albeit elementary) Makefile, or compile by hand. This was tested with g++, and worked(!). Should compile with the default libraries bundled with most Linux distributions, and if it doesn't, ok.

## USAGE
Obviously the primary aim of lcmnt is to read and write comments for files, but there is a bit of rubbish bundled with it. Run `lcmnt` for a basic manual, 
or look at the source code to see what four hours were spent on.

## BUGS
Spiders. Ants. Beetles. Most famously, a moth. Report them with repository issues if you want. Even writing this paragraph is overkill for a repository with literally no views.

## OTHERS
Leave an issue if you find an issue. If you still don't understand what this is, just test it. If you still still don't understand, you might be 
retar
